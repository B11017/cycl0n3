# Cycl0n3, A public tethered downgrading tool.

This tool only works for 15.0-15.7 (AKA "Modern Age").

# Supported Devices

A10-A16. That is AFTER development.

# Sourcement
This project ISNT open source. Yes, a release will be soon but work needs to be made. I know your thinking I'm just bricking stuff to make you all think I'm working on a project, but I'm actually working on one.
